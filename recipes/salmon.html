    <p>Cast iron salmon is rich, moist and delicious and so easy to make! Using just 4-ingredients you can have crispy skin salmon in just 20 minutes.  A super simple weeknight meal and a great head start ingredient for a busy week.
        Cast iron salmon is one of my favorite ways to make this fish.  It’s super easy to do and results in a moist and flakey salmon filet with super crispy skin.  Serve this up with a couple of simple sides (we love asparagus + rice pilaf) and you’ll have a delicious and nutritious dinner ready to go any night of the week.

    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>

        <li>A cut of salmon</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>A slice of lemon or lemon juice</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 F and place the pan in the oven.  Allow the pan to get nice and hot while your oven heats up.  This results in a nice crispy skin.</li>
        <li>Pat the salmon filets dry and season the salmon skin with kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Place the seasoned salmon, skin side down in the hot pan (be sure to grease the pan first).</li>
        <li>Season the top of the salmon with a little extra salt and some black pepper.</li>
        <li>Pop the pan back in the oven and cook for 4-6 minutes per 1/2 inch thickness of your salmon filets.</li>
    </ol>
