    <p>"Here’s how to cook steak like a chef – pan seared and basted with garlic thyme butter! It’s dramatic, simple cooking at its best, you’ll look like a total pro and feel like you’re dining at the best steakhouse in town….."</p>

    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Thickish cut steak –</strong> no more than 2.5cm/1″ thick, because we want to cook this entirely on the stove 
            (thicker cuts need to be finished in the oven). <strong>Ideal steaks:</strong> boneless rib eye / scotch fillet,
            porterhouse / New York, T-bone. <strong>Grade:</strong> takes high quality steak over the top amazing, really elevates economical steak.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Butter, garlic and fresh thyme</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through 
        evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;</li>
        <li>Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;</li>
        <li>Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for the crust</li>
        <li>WARNING: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!</li>
        <li>Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; 
            and REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!</li>
    </ol>
