    <p>Learn how to cook perfect, fluffy quinoa at home! Organic quinoa is a nutritious grain-like seed that is naturally free from gluten, packed full of protein and is a great alternative to rice. Perfect in salads and can even be served as porridge!</p>

    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The ratio is two cups of water for every cup of quinoa</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse quinoa thoroughly to remove any natural bitter flavour.</li>
        <li>Add rinsed quinoa and cooking liquid to a medium saucepan, then bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed (10 to 15 minutes). You can tell that it's cooked when it is a little translucent in the centre and looks like it has a circular 'tail'.</li>
        <li>Fluff with a fork and season if desired.</li>
        <li>Add to salads or use as a side dish in place of rice.</li>
    </ol>
